## Problem Statement

Table: Customer

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| referee_id  | int     |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.


 

Find the names of the customer that are either:


	referred by any customer with id != 2.
	not referred by any customer.


Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 
Example 1:

Input: 
Customer table:
+----+------+------------+
| id | name | referee_id |
+----+------+------------+
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
